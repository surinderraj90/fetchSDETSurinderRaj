Steps to execute the file
1. Download and install the latest version of PyCharm(install the default python setting in regards to pip etc) and google chrome.
2. Install the python version 3.12 and use it as an interpreter.
3. Click on File --> Setting. Select Project: pythonProject. Click in the "+" sign on the top left.
4. Type Selinium and it would install the latest selinium version.
5. Now that you have the Selinium and the python installed. Open the file --> testToFindFakeGoldBar.py (found in this repo) from the PyCharm and run the file.
6. You get an O/P: 
"We have found the correct fake bar
Fake Gold Bar: 7"

Algorithm:
Divide the 9 bars into 3 groups (Group 1, Group 2, Group 3), with 3 bars in each.
Weigh Group 1 against Group 2.
If they balance, the fake is in Group 3. Otherwise, it's in the lighter group.
Take the group with the fake bar, divide it into 3 bars again, and weigh two of them.
If they balance, the fake is the one not being weighed. If they don't, the lighter one is the fake.

Note:
This code was written very quickly so I did not consider many edge cases.
There could be try block implemented to handle exceptions it better.
There are 2 weighing functions written, it can be sized down to one function. 
The Method WebDriverWait can be implemented to make sure we get result instead of waiting for 15 seconds:
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((

Given the configuration are right I think we are good to go.
